An individual will not be allowed to work for the company for one month following voluntary termination of membership unless their membership is reinstated by the company.

No member may be expelled or suspended, and no membership or memberships may be terminated or suspended, except according to procedures satisfying the requirements of this section.

A member may for any lawful reason be expelled from the company by a vote of seventy-five percent (75%) or greater of the members at a duly called meeting at which a quorum is present.

The member must be given 15 days’ prior notice of the expulsion, suspension, or termination and the reasons therefor and the member shall have an opportunity to be heard, orally or in writing, not less than five days before the effective date of the expulsion, suspension, or termination by a person or body authorized to decide that the proposed expulsion, termination, or suspension not take place.

Any notice required under this section may be given by any method reasonably calculated to provide actual notice.  Any notice given by mail must be given by first-class or registered mail sent to the last address of the members shown on the company’s records.

A member who is expelled or suspended or whose membership is terminated shall be liable for any charges incurred, dues, assessments, or fees incurred before expulsion, suspension, or termination or arising from contract or otherwise.

The company may direct a member whose expulsion is being considered to refrain from conducting business as a member until the expulsion decision is made, provided the company pays the member their average weekly wage – calculated based on the three months preceding the date of the notice given pursuant to this section – until the expulsion decision is made.  The company may also direct a member whose expulsion is being considered to stay away from the company’s places of business except as necessary to exercise her or his rights under law.

Any request by the company to a member for consent to conduct a meeting of members by electronic transmission by and to the corporation shall include a notice that absent consent of the member, the meeting shall be held at a physical location.

Whenever the members are required to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 90 days before the date of the meeting to each member who, on the record date for notice of the meeting, is entitled to vote thereat; provided, however, that if notice is given by mail, and the notice is not mailed by first-class, registered, or certified mail, that notice shall be given not less than 20 days before the meeting.

The notice of any meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the names of all those who are nominees at the time the notice is given to members.

Notice of a members’ meeting or any report shall be given personally, by electronic transmission by the corporation, or by mail or other means of written communication, addressed to a member at the address of such member appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the member to the corporation for purpose of notice; or if no such address appears or is given, at the place where the principal office of the corporation is located or by publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the principal office is located. 

If any notice or report addressed to the member at the address of such member appearing on the books of the corporation is returned to the corporation by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice or report to the member at such address, all future notices or reports shall be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if the same shall be available for the member upon written demand of the member at the principal office of the corporation for a period of one year from the date of the giving of the notice or report to all other members.

Notice shall not be given by electronic transmission by the corporation under this section after either of the following:

- The corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive notices to the member by that means
- The inability to so deliver notices to the member becomes known to the secretary, any assistant secretary, or other person responsible for the giving of notice.

### G. Waiver of Notice

The transactions of any meeting of members however called and noticed, and wherever held, are as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the persons entitled to vote, not present in person, provides a waiver of notice or consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof in writing.  All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.  

Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at such meeting, except when the person objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required to be included in the notice but not so included, if such objection is expressly made at the meeting. 

Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of members need be specified in any written waiver of notice, consent to the holding of the meeting, or approval of the minutes thereof.

### H. Adjourned Meetings

When a members’ meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof (or the means of electronic transmission by and to the corporation or electronic video screen communication, if any, by which members may participate) are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.  If the adjournment is for more than 45 days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each member of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

### I. Quorum

A majority of the members shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of members.  If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the members entitled to vote shall be the act of the members unless the vote of a greater number is required by the articles or operating agreement.

The members present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough members to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the members required to constitute a quorum or, if required by the articles or the operating agreement, the vote of the greater number so required.

In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of members may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the votes represented in person, but no other business may be transacted, except as provided in the preceding paragraph.

### J. Record Date

The board may fix, in advance, a date as the record date for the purpose of determining the members entitled to vote at a meeting of members.  Such record date shall not be more than 60 days before the date of the meeting.  Such record date shall also apply in the case of an adjournment of the meeting unless the board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting.  If no record date is fixed, members on the day of the meeting who are otherwise eligible to vote are entitled to vote at the meeting of members or, in the case of an adjourned meeting, members on the day of the adjourned meeting who are otherwise eligible to vote are entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting of members.

## ARTICLE IV: DIRECTORS

### A. Directors and Board Composition

All members of the corporation shall serve on the board of directors and no person other than the members of the corporation shall serve on the board of directors (except as provided in the following paragraph).

The number of directors shall be not less than three or more than forty with the exact number of directors to be fixed, within the limits specified, by a vote of the members.  If there are fewer than three members, the member(s) shall elect the minimum required number of directors to bring the total number of directors to three.

Should the number of members ever exceed forty, the members shall immediately meet to amend the operating agreement to require that the board be elected from among the members.

**Meetings of the members in their capacity as the board of directors shall be governed by this Article IV.  Meetings of the members in their capacity as members shall be governed by Article III.**

### B. Terms of Office

The term of office of the directors shall be one year.

Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until a successor has been elected and qualified.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person whose membership is terminated shall immediately cease to be a director of the corporation.

### C. Voting

The vote of a three fourths majority of the directors present at a duly called and noticed meeting at which a quorum is present is the act of the board. 

### D. Notice of Board Meetings

Regular meetings will be held the first Thursday of every month at 11:00 a.m. at the principal office of the corporation.  If the day fixed for the regular meeting falls on a legal holiday, the meeting shall be held at the same time and place on the next business day.  

Special meetings of the board shall be held upon four days’ notice by first-class mail or 48 hours’ notice delivered personally, by telephone, including a voice messaging system, or by electronic transmission by the corporation.  A notice, or waiver of notice, need not specify the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the board.

### E. Waiver of Notice 

Notice of a meeting need not be given to any director who provides a waiver of notice or consent to holding the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof in writing, whether before or after the meeting, or who attends the meeting without protesting, prior thereto or at its commencement, the lack of notice to that director.

All waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meetings.

### F. Participation by Electronic Transmission

Members of the board may participate in a meeting through use of conference telephone, electronic video screen communication, or electronic transmission by and to the corporation.  Participation in a meeting through use of conference telephone or electronic video screen communication pursuant to this section constitutes presence in person at that meeting as long as all members participating in the meeting are able to hear one another.

Participation in a meeting through use of electronic transmission by and to the corporation, other than conference telephone and electronic video screen communication pursuant to this subdivision constitutes presence in person at that meeting if both of the following apply:

1. Each director participating in the meeting can communicate with all of the other members concurrently; and
2. Each director is provided the means of participating in all matters before the board, including, without limitation, the capacity to propose, or to interpose an objection to, a specific action to be taken by the corporation.

### G. Quorum

A majority of the number of directors then in office constitutes a quorum of the board for the transaction of business.

A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for the meeting, or a greater number as is required by the articles or operating agreement.

### H. Adjournment

A majority of the directors present, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn any meeting to another time and place.  If the meeting is adjourned for more than 24 hours, notice of any adjournment to another time or place shall be given prior to the time of the adjourned meeting to the directors who were not present at the time of the adjournment.

### I. Action Without a Meeting

Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the board shall individually or collectively consent in writing to such action.  Such written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board.

The action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the directors.

### J. Board Vacancies

Given that all members constitute the board, vacancies will not occur on the board.  Therefore, this section applies only if the provision requiring that all members constitute the board is amended to provide for election of directors (or if there are fewer than three members).

“Vacancy” when used with respect to the board means any authorized position of director which is not then filled, whether the vacancy is caused by death, resignation, removal, change in the number of directors authorized in the articles or operating agreement, or otherwise.

The board may declare vacant the office of a director whose eligibility for election as a director has ceased, or who has been declared of unsound mind by a final order of court, or convicted of a felony.

Except for a vacancy created by the removal of a director, vacancies on the board may be filled by approval of the board or, if the number of directors then in office is less than a quorum, by (1) the unanimous written consent of the directors then in office, (2) the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office at a meeting held pursuant to notice or waivers of notice, or (3) a sole remaining director.

Vacancies occurring on the board by reason of the removal of directors may be filled only by the members.

The members may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the directors.

### K. Resignation

So long as all members constitute the board, the only way that a director may resign is by ceasing to be a member (or if there are fewer than three members).  Should the provision by which all members constitute the board be amended, any director may resign effective upon giving written notice to the president, the secretary, or the board of directors of the corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for the effectiveness of such resignation.  If the resignation is effective at a future time, a successor may be elected to take office when the resignation becomes effective.

### L. Removal

So long as all members constitute the board, directors may not be removed except if they cease to be members.  Should the provision by which all members constitute the board be amended, any or all directors may be removed without cause by the members.

Any reduction of the authorized number of directors does not remove any director prior to the expiration of the director’s term of office.

## ARTICLE V: COMMITTEES

The board may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the number of directors then in office, provided that a quorum is present, create one or more committees, each consisting of two or more directors, to serve at the pleasure of the board.  Appointments to such committees shall be by a majority vote of the directors then in office.  The board may appoint one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent member at any meeting of the committee.  Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board or in the operating agreement, shall have all the authority of the board, except with respect to:
