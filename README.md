### E. Removal of Members
No member may be expelled or suspended, and no membership or memberships may be terminated or suspended, except according to procedures satisfying the requirements of this section.

A member may for any lawful reason be expelled from the company by a vote of seventy-five percent (75%) or greater of the members at a duly called meeting at which a quorum is present.

The member must be given 15 days’ prior notice of the expulsion, suspension, or termination and the reasons therefor and the member shall have an opportunity to be heard, orally or in writing, not less than five days before the effective date of the expulsion, suspension, or termination by a person or body authorized to decide that the proposed expulsion, termination, or suspension not take place.

Any notice required under this section may be given by any method reasonably calculated to provide actual notice.  Any notice given by mail must be given by first-class or registered mail sent to the last address of the members shown on the company’s records.

A member who is expelled or suspended or whose membership is terminated shall be liable for any charges incurred, dues, assessments, or fees incurred before expulsion, suspension, or termination or arising from contract or otherwise.

The company may direct a member whose expulsion is being considered to refrain from conducting business as a member until the expulsion decision is made, provided the company pays the member their average weekly wage – calculated based on the three months preceding the date of the notice given pursuant to this section – until the expulsion decision is made.
